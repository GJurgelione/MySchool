# Backend project using Node.js

This backend project is built using Node.js. It provides APIs for interacting with the frontend or any other client applications. Below are the available scripts to run and manage the backend:

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start` 
Runs the backend in the development mode.
The server will be listening on http://localhost:4000.

The server will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code.
You may also see any errors or logs in the console.

### `npm run dev`
Runs the backend in the development mode with Nodemon.
Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

### `npm run build`
Builds the backend for production to the build folder.
It prepares the backend for deployment, optimization, and enhanced performance in production environments.

The build is minified, and the filenames include unique identifiers.
Your backend is now ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Important Note
Before running any of the scripts, make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies by running npm install. Also, ensure that your MongoDB or any other database connection is properly configured in the backend code.
